<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, So, I am sure you are wondering why I have gathered you all here today after all these years<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  I am hoping it is because you owe us some money<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> No, Sadly that is not the reason<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> That would be too good to be true<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> Yeh right.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> So, what is the reason<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I'd like to think I have some exciting news for you all<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  Well I can't wait to hear it, I'd like a bit of excitement at the moment<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Now everyone knows you girls were a smash hit back in the early 90's<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes but that was then and this is now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Exactly, the kids today have probably never heard of us<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  We are old news now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes but you were huge! Superstars! People don't forget that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  Anyway, that was the long distant past, it has been over for many years now, so why are we here Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> That may have been the past – but here is the future<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  What future. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Girlz -R -Uz will ride again. I want to get the group back together again.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> You are joking aren't you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  We haven't sung together for well over 20 years<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Exactly! So about time you made a comeback<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> A ridiculous idea. It will be more like Girlz – Were – Uz<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Exactly. That was a chapter of our life that is over now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Come on, be positive. I know it will work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> We were so young then Jed. We are heading towards our fifties now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Nonsense, None of you are near 50<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  You are wrong Jed, I am 48 in June<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> But be realistic. There are dozens of female singers out there in their fifties<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Yeh that's true but were were never great singers Jed, you know that. Our appeal was that we were young, sexy, and danced around with very little clothing on<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I remember it well. Mmmmm<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Keep it as a memory Jed, it wouldn't look the same now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> The only time I wear very little now clothing is bedtime<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I think You all look very sexy still<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh come off it Jed. Take a look at me, what do you see?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  I see a very attractive lady<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Thank you Jed but did you by any chance notice the grey hair? I do, every time I look in the mirror<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> There are such things as hair dyes you know<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Every time I look in the mirror all I see is the bags under my eyes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> I see lines around my eyes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  I have put on 10 kilos since those days<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Every time I look in the mirror, I see my mum looking back at me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Girls, girls. Stop it! You are all still very attractive women<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF"> I am not saying I am unhappy with the way I am. Everyone gets older, if they are lucky, but we definitely do not look like a girl band any longer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> I had a knee op last year so all that dancing about would be a no-no for me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> I just got married for the third time. I am not sure my new husband would take kindly to me being back on the road again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> You have to think seriously about this ladies. It could be a great opportunity for you all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> Why now Jed.Why this sudden interest in getting us back together again?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I just happened to hear one of your old songs on the radio the other day and I just thought what a great idea to get you recording again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Rubbish! They haven't played any of our songs on the radio for years. What's the real reason Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> ( A short pause) Ok you found me out. I didn't hear a song<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> So what is it then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  To be honest with you I am broke.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Ahhh, it is all making sense now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes! You are not doing this for us you are doing it for you:
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> No, no not at all I am doing it for all of us. Come on be honest with me. What have you all done since the band split?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> I work on the tills at Aldi<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  Hmm. I run a guest house but if I am honest, it doesn't do that well.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Better than me probably. I got made redundant two years ago, now I am a dog walker<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> I did a bit of glamour modelling but that dried up years ago. Now I just work as a hotel receptionist<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> For the last three years I have worked for  a TV company<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh that sounds quite cool Michelle<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Well not really. I meant I work for a company that makes TV's<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh dear, oh dear. You all deserve better than that. You could be superstars once more. Trust me!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Last time we trusted you we ended up playing on a cross channel ferry<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok, that was a mistake but things will be better, I promise<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  I can make a promise too. I promise I won't do this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Of come on Jan. Surely it would be better than running a guest house<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> I just wouldn't have the confidence now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  And who would book us? It has been so long since we performed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I know I can get you bookings, I just know it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  To be honest, I am going nowhere at the moment so I could be tempted to give it a try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> I really don't think it would work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  You never know until you try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> Working at Aldi's is certainly not the most exciting experience of my life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> If we did it what would we sing? And what would we wear?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> We couldn't wear the same costumes that we used to that's for sure<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I can take care of all that. And I have gig lined up already<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> But why us Jed? Why not get five new young girls?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Because I like you girls. You were winners before and you can be winners again<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  I don't buy that, there must be another reason<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Well yes. I tried that and it didn't work. All the good ones get snapped up by TV talent shows<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Would we use the same name? Girlz-R-Uz?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Of course, Why change something that works?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  It was 20 years ago that it worked Jed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  It will work again, I know it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Why don't we give it a try girls? What have we got to lose<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Not much I suppose<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  I am not sure I have the confidence now that I had then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  I was thinking that too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Don't worry, the old confidence will come back You girls are going to be on TV<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> You can't promise us that Jed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh yes I can. Just agree to this and I guarantee you a TV spot<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok count me in<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Me too I suppose<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> I don't want to let the others down so yes I'll do it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok, I'm in too then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> I have misgivings but ok, I'm in<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> GREAT!! I am so pleased. Can we all meet back here a week from now? Next Monday and I'll make all the arrangements<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok see you then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok. Bye everyone<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> See you next week<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Hopefully it will all work out ok<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  I hope so, Bye everyone<p>

                  One Week Later<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Come in, come in girls I have been very busy and have everything organised. This is going to be so exciting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Hi Jed, pleased to hear that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> I am surprised you have achieved that in a week<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> More than I was expecting<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> I have been practising with some of our old songs. I think I sound slightly better than a frog<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  I am sure much better than that Kay<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF"> At least you have practised Kay. I haven't had a chance<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> It's all ok, don't worry, we can work it out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Are we going into the studio?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  All in good time, we need to sort out contracts, costumes things like that first<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Nothing too sexy Jed we would look silly in things like that now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Don't worry girls, I have it all in hand<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> You said you had gigs lined up. How many?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I did say gig not gigs but who knows from there on<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Where is it? <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> We'll sort all that out later<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> And you said TV?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes I did and that is a promise<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Why is it such a secret then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> No secret, I just want to do things in the right order<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok so how do we start? We can't sing here in the office we need a studio<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Very true and I have a studio booked for the day after tomorrow.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  So what do we do today<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Today we sort out the costumes. They are all in that big trunk over there<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> That's a big trunk<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Well, there are five of you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  Let's have a look then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Help yourself<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Let me see<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes me too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  Are they new?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Hmm not exactly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Just a minute! These are some of the costumes we used to wear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> We did say Jed that we didn't want to dress in the same way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  It will work, I am sure it will, for the video we have planed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> What video<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> I told you. You are going to be on TV so we need to make a video<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Music video?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Are we really going to wear these costumes? They really are for younger people<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> You are going to look great in them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> I doubt that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Come on girls, try them on. Let's see how you look<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok I'll put it on but if I don't feel comfortable I won't do the video<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> That's fair enough. All of you behind the screen now and get changed<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Never thought I would wear something like this again. I'll try it though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  I suppose this doesn't look too bad<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  This looked good when I was 22, not so sure now though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  We used to love these costumes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes but it was a different time then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> I have got it on but it is very tight on me, I need to diet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  No time for that Jan we have a video to make<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  You have given us so little information Jed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, where are we going to shoot the video and what song will we have<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes you seem to be very secretive Jed. I think it is time you gave us a little more information<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> All in good time, all in good time<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Never mind about all in good time Jed, we want some more details now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes! We have managed to squeeze into these costumes as you asked, so tell us what is going on<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> As you know I promised you TV exposure<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes you did, so is it a music show?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Errrr not exactly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Well what is it then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  You have to remember girls, any TV is good TV<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> What is it Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> You'll love this, it's a TV ad. Lots of stars make TV ads. It will be great publicity<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> What is the TV ad for Jed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> To be honest girls, it really doesn't matter what it is for, just appearing on TV is always good<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> What's it for Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> And I am sure that once people see you on TV again the offers will come flooding in<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  But what is the ad for Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok, ok I will be frank with you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> At last<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> The reason I asked you girls is that you will be so perfect for the ad<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Which is?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Errr.. It's a travel ad<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh that sounds good<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> Will we be shooting somewhere exotic?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Well, not too exotic<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF"> Where then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> South coast<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Of France?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  No, England<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  But it is November Jed. We can't shoot outside in these clothes in an English winter<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> We'll get those big industrial outside heaters<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle:</font color="#0000FF">  What kind of travel video is it going to be if we are freezing our boobs off in an English winter<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> That's the whole point. Get out of England into the warm sunshine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan: </font color="#0000FF"> Exactly which travel company is this for Jed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Well, you know travel companies, they are all pretty much the same.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  No they are not Jed. Which one is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> And a TV ad is always good for publicity<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Which one Jed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Probably one you have never heard of<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula:</font color="#0000FF">  Try is. Which one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  (Mumbles something quite intelligible)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michelle: </font color="#0000FF"> What was that Jed? You were mumbling<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Ok, ok I will tell you (short pause) It is for Saga<p>
<font color="#0000FF">All girls: </font color="#0000FF"> SAGA!!!!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  It's going to be great<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  No it isn't. Saga do holidays for retired and elderly people<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, mostly older people<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay:</font color="#0000FF">  We will make an ad for OLD PEOPLE!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> So that is why you wanted us you creep. Because you thought we looked elderly and nearing retirement<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jan:</font color="#0000FF">  I just knew there was something a bit odd about this whole thing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> No, no I promise you girls you have it all wrong.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Kay: </font color="#0000FF"> I don't think we do Jed. You sneaky thing. You think we are over the hill and past it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> No, I promise you I don't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie: </font color="#0000FF"> Well if you think we are going to stand in the English rain in theses skimpy costumes while we make a video looking like we are on our last legs you are mistaken<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> It'll be a great opportunity for you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paula: </font color="#0000FF"> Well we don't want it girls do we<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes! A joke I only did it because you girls were so worried about looking older. You all look great still, in fact amazing. The saga thing was a joke<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  What does that mean then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jed: </font color="#0000FF"> What it means is we are making a travel video but we are flying out to Los Angeles on Friday where you will be rehearsing, making a new album and shooting a video for the American tourism board?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Ellie:</font color="#0000FF">  Really? - You are not joking?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jed:</font color="#0000FF">  Not at all – get your bags packed – You are going to be superstars again<p>
